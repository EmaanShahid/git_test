//connecting local to remote repositoty
but, first change master to main as per new guidelines(git branch -M main)

 'branch' is used in three ways:
 1. for creating a new branch (git branch branch_name)
 2. for listing all branches  (git branch )
 3. for deleting a branch (git branch -D branch_name)

 * for creating a new branch  and automatically checkout it ( git checkout -b branch_name )
